# hello-world
This is my first github project!

My name is Justin DeMuro. My first exposure to coding was in middle school, where I would tinker with Visual Basic, making simple programs using the easy WYSIWYG editor. I then took classes in high school teaching me Visual Basic, C++, and Java. In college, I spent many more hours writing code in C++, Perl, bash scripting, and again, Java for various courses. Toward the end of my college career I held a position as a front-end Web Developer, where I built out websites in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a LAMP stack environment.

These days I work in SAN for a major storage company, and I don't get to do much scripting professionally or academically. Lately I've been tinkering with AutoHotKey, where I've created a few scripts, one of which has evolved into a full fledged application. I intent to continue the progress of those scripts and many more here on GitHub. I also intend to learn more languages and get back into web-development.

Thanks for reading!
